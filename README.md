Led the development of a multi-agent AI system powered by LLMs to monitor social media (X/Twitter) for compliance risks in enterprise data. Built using CrewAI, LangChain, and Grok API.

- **Key Features**: Real-time search for company mentions, risk analysis with RAG and Chain-of-Thought reasoning, short/long-term memory, tool integration, and cloud-like optimization.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, CrewAI, LangChain, Grok API (free tier), FAISS for vector search.
- **Demo**: Run in Google Colab for free.

This project demonstrates production-grade agentic AI for business productivity, aligning with roles in AI engineering.
